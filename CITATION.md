# Citation

If you use Ray Optics Simulation in your research, please cite it according to the following instruction depending on the version you are using.

## The online version

If you are using the [online version](https://phydemo.app/ray-optics/simulator/), please check if you are using any beta features (if some are used, a "Beta" icon is shown in the lower left corner of the web app). If no beta features are used, then please cite [the Zenodo record of the latest release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6386611) by following the "Citation" or "Export" panel there. If beta features are used, you may either cite as above but with additional comment on the usage of beta features (as the latest release does not include beta features), or directly cite the GitHub repository with access date.

## Other versions

If you are running the project locally, please follow the Zenodo link of the version you are using in the [Releases](https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics/releases) page if you downloaded it there. If you are not using a released version (e.g. downloaded from a previous "latest deployment" link or cloned from the repository), you may either cite the Zenodo record corresponding to the most recent parent release of the version you are using with comment on the usage of beta/modified features (if any), or directly cite the GitHub repository with access date.
