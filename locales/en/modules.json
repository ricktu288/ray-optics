      "description": "This tutorial will guide you through the basics of making a custom module, which can be done entirely within the web app, without the need of any external development environment.",
      "moduleIntroduction": "The \"Module\" feature of Ray Optics Simulation allows the creation of modular combinations of objects with custom parameters, custom control points, and arrays of objects. This feature extends the capability of this simulator by combining, specializing, or reparametrizing objects created by existing tools to make new tools. For example, the `CircleSource` module (see Tools -> Other -> Import module) combines an array of point sources created by the existing \"Point Source (<360°)\" tool along a circle, to make a \"circular source\" tool which didn't exist in the simulator. The `FresnelLens` module specializes the \"Glass->Custom equation\" tool, so that the equation represents a specific curve of the Fresnel lens parametrized by the number of slices, thus making a specialized \"Fresnel lens\" tool, which also didn't exist before. In addition to making new tools, this feature can also make some optics demonstrations more interactive. For example, by dragging the third control point of the `BeamExpander` module, one can directly see how the position of the common focal point of the two lenses affects the beam width, without needing to adjust the focal lengths of the two lenses individually.",
      "compareWithHandle": "Note that not all custom control points require a module. Some simple cases can be achieved by the \"handle\" feature (see the \"Group, rotate, and scale objects\" section in the help popup at the bottom right corner of the simulator). Since making a module is much more complicated than creating a handle, you should first check if your case can be achieved by the \"handle\" feature before considering making a module. See [here](/gallery/black-cat-becomes-white) for a non-trivial example of a custom control point (moving two plastic bags out of water) without using a module.",
      "compareWithIntegrations": "On the other hand, if your case requires complicated programming (such as making animations, using complicated algorithm to place optical elements, or doing analysis on irradiance maps), please instead use the [integration tools](/integrations) and write scripts such as in Python or Julia.",

You can also use it to edit existing modules or to modularize scenes.",

So when you click any of the last two texts in this example, you are just selecting the module object, and not the objects in the module.

We will learn how to make them draggable by using control points later.",

      "createModule": "The suggested way of creating a module currently is to first create an empty module using the JSON editor, create some objects using the visual scene editor, and then cut and paste the objects from `objs` to `modules.ModuleName.objs` using the JSON editor."

Within a string (such as the `text` property of a `TextLabel`), the equations of the variables are enclosed by a pair of backticks. For number parameters (such as the `fontSize` property of a `TextLabel`), you need to make it a string so that you can use the backtick format in it, so each equation is sandwiched by a pair of backticks and a pair of quotes. The equation are evaluated with math.js ([syntax](/mathjs/syntax)). See there for the available syntax and functions you can use in the equations.",

The coordinates of the control points are (`x_1`, `y_1`), (`x_2`, `y_2`), etc, and are used in the same ways as the parameters within `modules.ExampleModule.objs` as described by the previous section. Note that the index starts from 1.",
      "valueStorage": "The actual values of the coordinates of the control points are stored in the `points` property of the module object, which, unlike the hard-coded coordinates in Example 1, can be edited by the visual scene editor by dragging the control points, each shown as two concentric gray circles in the scene. If you drag elsewhere in the module object (such as dragging the text labels), all the control points will move together.",

The name of the module is shown in the Tools -> Other menu, and you can select that and then click two points in the blank space in sequence for the two control points to create another instance of the module.

The value of the `\"for\"` key is either a string of the format `\"name=start:step:end\"` defining a loop variable, or an array of several strings of this format describing a multidimensional loop. Such an object in the array is duplicated several times according to the loop variables. The value of the `\"if\"` key is a string representing a math.js expression that evaluates to a boolean, and such an object is included in the array if and only if the boolean is true.",

To represent such an equation in math.js and refer to module parameters, etc, you need to wrap the math.js expression in a pair of double backticks. Such a block expands to a LaTeX equation with free variables like \\(x\\) for `x` and \\(\\theta_0\\) for `theta_0`, which is different from a single-backtick block which expects no free variables and expands to a number. Here is an example of a custom equation mirror containing a custom parameter `phi`",

You can use custom functions defined in the `vars` array, but the function definitions must ultimately consist of those allowed operations.",
