The mirrors are designed to focus light at a specific point.

The illusion is so convincing that people often try to touch the image, only to find there's nothing there.\n\nMirascopes are popular in science demonstrations, toys, and novelty items to illustrate the principles of optics, reflection, and the behavior of light.",

Note that these are not total internal reflections, so the intensities of the outgoing rays are much lower than the incoming rays. Since the [minimum deviation angles](/gallery/minimum-deviation-angle) depend on the wavelength, different colors accumulate at different angles. Hence the colors in the rainbows are produced. Away from the minimum angles, the rays do not accumulate, so all colors are weak and mixed together, producing the dim white (or \"gray\") color at the angles just outside the two rainbows. On the other hand, no rays go to the angle between the two rainbows, forming Alexandar's dark band.",

The two apertures can be used to either change the intensity and numerical aperture (NA) or the field of view of your illumination. The second aperture is particularly advantageous, as you can close it to focus your sample. If the edges of the aperture are in focus, then the sample is focused too. It is also referred to as a 4f-setup, since it uses four focal lengths in distance.",
